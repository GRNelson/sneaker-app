1. An "operator" is a symbol that links two variables. The 4 operators are:
  (+, -, *, / ) and they work like normal math and follow PEMDAS.

2. The 5 primitive types are: string, boolean, undefined, null
  and number.

  3. Define primitive types:

  45 = Number
  "I heart JS" = String
  'Pizza is life'= String
  3.4 = Number
  true= Boolean
  " " = Undefined
  false = Null
  '5,555' = String

  4. Expressions give value to variables. In web design,
      a specific expression would give functionality to
      an interactive website.
