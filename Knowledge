Knowledge:
  When float is applied to an element, the element will shift all the way in the
  direction it is told until it hits the next element.

  1. A text element should be floated if you want the text wrapped around
    a picture.
  2. By changing the value of the float property to left or right, the element
   will shift in that direction. Elements coming after a floating element will
   also shift and flow around the floating element.
  3. The clear element tells the floating element which sides it cannot float
    to.
